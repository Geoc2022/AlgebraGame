Title "Algebra Game"
Introduction
"
# Welcome to the Algebra Game
#### An introduction to algebraic structures.

In this game, we will build the basic theory of Groups, Rings, and Fields from scratch. We'll do this by solving levels of a computer puzzle game called Lean.

It's recommend that you play the [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/NNG4) to learn the basics of Lean before playing this game.
