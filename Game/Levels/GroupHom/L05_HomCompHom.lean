Title "Composition of homomorphism is also a homomorphism"

namespace MyAlgebra

Introduction "
  We have seen that the identity function is a homomorphism. Now we will see that the composition of two homomorphisms is also a homomorphism.

  `GroupHom` is defined as a structure with a proof that the function is a homomorphism, and the function itself. To create a new `GroupHom` instance, we need to provide the function and the proof.

  We can use the `use` tactic to prove the existence of a type using construction. For example to prove that there is a number `x ∈ ℤ` such that `∀ n : ℤ, x + n = n` you can write `use 0` which will replace the goal with `0 + n = n`. In this case, you might want to use it to create a new `GroupHom` instance. The tactic `use` takes a function as an argument, and then asks us to prove that the function is a homomorphism.

  Furthermore, you can construct functions using `λ` notation and ∘ (written \"\\circ\"). For example, `λ x y, x + y` is the function that takes `x, y` to `x + y`. And `f ∘ g` is the function that takes `x` to `f (g x)`.
